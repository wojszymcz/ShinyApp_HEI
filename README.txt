This is final description of the code for the project. 

We have developed a Shiny App with two goals:
	1) Exploration of spatial surrounding of the university isochrones
	2) Analsysis of best-paid majors, based on administrative data, user's choice and user's area
We have combined three data sources - HEI information from POLON - register data on universities in Poland, spatial data and ELA GOV - data on graduates earnings. 
Our final project can be used by prospective students to analyse, what choice of university can lead to highest wages. 

We used R skills, learnt during course and beyond:
	1) Shiny Application - we have built the app using shiny library 
	2) Writing advanced functions - we have used them to use defensive-programming to ensure user inserts correct coordinates; used loops and conditions to ensure best user's experience
	3) Vectorisation of the code - we use it to increase the speed of the code
	4) Additional knowledge - webscrapping for getting the data from wikipedia - geocoordinates*, tidyverse functions, spatial analysis functions, CSS and HTML for tuning the visual part of the app

In case of any question, please contact Wojciech Szymczak via: wojszymcz@gmail.com
